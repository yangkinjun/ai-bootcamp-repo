## Project Scope
This project aims to transform how HR practitioners and workers in Singapore access, understand, and act on employment regulations and workplace rights. By integrating AI technologies, the solution provides:

- **Automated, reliable guidance** on employment law and workplace issues, reducing the need for manual research and interpretation.
- **Multilingual, inclusive support** for Singapore‚Äôs diverse workforce, ensuring accessibility for non-English speakers.
- **Scalable, updatable knowledge base** that can ingest new MOM documents and guidelines as regulations evolve.
- **Secure, privacy-conscious architecture** for handling sensitive workplace queries and user data.
- **User-centric design** with intuitive interfaces for both HR professionals and workers, supporting both quick lookups and in-depth grievance assistance.

The project is structured around two main use cases:

### Use Case 1: üí¨ Employment Regulations Chatbot
- An AI-powered chatbot that answers questions about Singapore employment law, MOM guidelines, and HR best practices. It leverages retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to provide context-aware, document-backed responses.

### Use Case 2: ü§ù Workplace Ally
- An AI-powered assistant that helps workers articulate grievances, understand their rights, and explore resolution pathways. It supports multilingual input and empathetic, supportive guidance.

The solution is designed for extensibility, allowing future integration with additional data sources, regulatory updates, and new conversational features.
